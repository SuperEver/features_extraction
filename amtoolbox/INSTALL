--------- Running the toolbox --------------------

AMToolbox depends on LTFAT.  You must first download LTFAT from
http://ltfat.sourceforge.net/ and unpack the downloaded file.

To start LTFAT in Matlab or Octave type "ltfatstart" as the first
command from the installation directory. This will set up the correct
paths. Similarly, type "amtstart" to start AMToolbox.

In Octave you can put these commands in your ~/.octaverc file. In Matlab
you can put these command in your startup.m file. Your startup file of
choice should contain some lines like this:

addpath /path/to/ltfat
addpath /path/to/amtoolbox
ltfatstart;
amtstart;

The "ltfatstart" and "amtstart" commands will add all the necessary
subdirectories (so please don't add these manually), and will print
statements telling you which backend you are currently using.

-------- Compiling the toolbox ------- ------------

If you wish to compile the C and Fortran functions in the toolbox,
execute the "amtmex" command. This will execute all the necessary
compilation scripts if you have the required compilers installed.
