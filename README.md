Installation:
============

In short if all dependences are installed on the system 
you can install **feature_extraction** within the cli:

>> python setup.py build && python setup.py install

If you are installing from source using conda  and
dependences are not installed you can do:

- get **feature_extraction** from github:

>> git clone https://github.com/bootphon/features_extraction

- create your environment, for example if using conda

>> cd features_extraction
>> conda create --name feat --file requirements.txt 
>> source activate feat

- install other dependences that are not available with conda

(feat) >> pip install git+http://github.com/bootphon/spectral
(feat) >> pip install git+https://github.com/bootphon/h5features    



Dependecies
===========

python dependences:

- spectral
- h5features
- octave

octave dependences:

- ltfat
- amtoolbox
- rastamat
- signal (octave package), require control and general
- AuditoryToolbox

To run rastama the previous packages you will need a 
working octave's distribution, these packages depends of 
the octaves packages: **general**, **control** and **signal**.
To install the packages, from octave's console line you'll need
to run:

>> pkg install -forge general
>> pkg install -forge control
>> pkg install -forge signal

AuditoryToolbox depends on compiled octave/matlab mex files, to 
create these file you will need to compile the files within the 
AuditoryToolbox directory, in linux command line **on** AuditoryToolbox/src
directory do:

>> make 

Notes
=====

for now, octave features dont have many options since they are hard coded.
.mat output for python features not implemented yet
center_times in some octave features are wrong...


Example:

	python features.py test/wavs/*.wav -h5 my_mfccs.h5f -c mfcc_config.json

see config options at config_doc.rst
